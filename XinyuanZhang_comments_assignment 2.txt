Read Data
1.5/3
You should ahve written a function for this even though you can just call read_csv.
Consider the other kinds of files you might want to read, or dealing with
loading smaller chunks of the dataset(only the first 100 rows), or having to handle missing files,
etc.

Explore
4.5/9
Ditto above. Also, just showing data.count and a few scatter plots is not really sufficient
exploration. You should have functions to plot histograms/kde plots of features, scatter plots,
boxplots, etc.
Also, the scatter plots you have are not as informative as they could be. You should instead
plot the histograms of the features after theyve been grouped by the target column.
The scatter plots you have are just so awkward to read b/c theyre just dots(and you cant tell how
dense the dots are) at y = 0 and y = 1.

Preprocess
2/6
Again, you should have functions like the following:
    def fill_missing_vals(df, cols, impute_method='mean')
Also, you dont handle outliers.

Generating Features
0/6
I dont see any code to generate features.

Classifier
3/3

Evaluation
1/3
You should have a function like
    def evaluate(fitted_model, X, Y, eval_metric)

Notebook:
3/10
What you have in your notebook leaves a lot to be desired. The exploratory data analysis is
not sufficient; the plots you happen to show dont tell us enough.
You should comment with your findings/thoughts/analysis on what the data exploration +
classification
results tell you.


Total:
15/40
There just isnt enough here. I think most of the value of this class comes from
getting your hands dirty with the data analysis and figuring out how to
write clean code to do avoid writing the same kind of data cleaning/wrangling code over
and over again.
I understand that you were busy with interviews. In that case, I'd encourage you to ask
Rayid if you can resubmit a more thoroughly finished homework.
